### COVID-19 Policies vs. State Economy Analysis 
**role:** data cleaner + analyst    
**duration:** Nov 2020 - Dec 2020  
**overview:**  

I worked in a team of five to conduct a data science project from start to finish. Our focus was analyzing the realtionship between COVID-19 policies and individual state economies to determine if a relationship exists. We chose to analyze California, Nevada, and Utah because of their geographical proximity and varying economies. After several iterations, we decided on a research question:
> Do state-wide COVID-19 policies in California, Nevada, and Utah have a significant effect on that state's economy? Specifically, what effect is there, if any, of government policy on a state's unemployment rates, consumer spending, and small business revenue?


Our process in 7 steps:  
1. Formulate Research Question 
2. Find Datasets
3. Clean Datasets
4. Conduct Exploratory Analysis 
5. Extract Relevant Data
6. Analyze Data & Produce Visuals
7. Draw Conclusions.
